This material is not intended as a recommendation, offer, or solicitation to purchase or sell securities, open a brokerage account, or engage in any investment strategy. Stocks, ETFs, Options, Bonds. Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and Bonds, except for treasury securities offered through Jiko Securities, Inc., are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA & SIPC . Additional information about your broker can be found by clicking here . Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public Holdings”). This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered. Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured. Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular SIPC limits. Additional information can be found here . Options. Certain requirements must be met in order to trade options. Options can be risky and are not suitable for all investors. Options transactions are often complex, and investors can rapidly lose the entire amount of their investment or more in a short period of time. Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing in options. Refer to the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options before considering any options transaction. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request. Tax considerations with options transactions are unique and investors considering options should consult their tax advisor as to how taxes affect the outcome of each options strategy. Options Order Flow Rebates. If you are enrolled in our Options Order Flow Rebate Program, Public Investing will share a percentage of our estimated order flow revenue for each completed options trade as a rebate to help reduce your trading costs. Rebate rates vary monthly from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on your current and prior month’s options trading volume. This rebate will be deducted from your cost to place the trade and will be reflected on your trade confirmation. To learn more, see our Options Rebate Program Terms & Conditions , Order Rebate FAQ and Fee Schedule . Bonds. “Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing. For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section. Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes. A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our Fee Schedule . Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions. Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with fixed income and fractional bonds . See Bond Account Disclosures to learn more. High-Yield Cash Account. A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing. Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See here for a list of current Partner Banks. Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash. Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. Learn more . Cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency trading, execution, and custody services are provided by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (NMLS ID 1828849) (“Bakkt”). Cryptocurrency is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and has the potential for loss of the entire amount of an investment. Cryptocurrencies offered by Bakkt are not securities and are not FDIC insured or protected by SIPC . Your cryptocurrency assets are held in your Bakkt account. Bakkt is a licensed virtual currency business by the New York State Department of Financial Services and a licensed money transmitter, but is not a registered broker-dealer or a FINRA member. Your Bakkt Crypto account is separate from your brokerage account with Public Investing, which holds US-listed stocks and ETFs. Please review the Risk Disclosures before trading. Treasury Accounts. Investing services in treasury accounts offering 6 month US Treasury Bills on the Public platform are through Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA & SIPC . See JSI’s FINRA BrokerCheck and Form CRS for further information. JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures for further details. Investments in T-bills: Not FDIC Insured; No Bank Guarantee; May Lose Value. Banking services and bank accounts are offered by Jiko Bank, a division of Mid-Central National Bank. JSI and Jiko Bank are not affiliated with Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public”) or any of its subsidiaries. None of these entities provide legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should consult your legal, tax, or financial advisors before making any financial decisions. This material is not intended as a recommendation, offer, or solicitation to purchase or sell securities, open a brokerage account, or engage in any investment strategy. Commission-free trading refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the US Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing. Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account. Please see Public’s Investing’s Fee Schedule to learn more. Fractional shares are illiquid outside of Public and not transferable.

Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs. Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency. Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations. Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile. You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan. Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk. See our Investment Plans Terms and Conditions and Sponsored Content and Conflicts of Interest Disclosure . Alpha.

            "   - **Rationale**: Given the volatile nature of Tesla stock, leverage momentum trading strategies to capitalize on short-term price movements. \n",
            "   - **Execution**: Monitor TSLA's stock price sentiment on the news (e.g., impacts from the EU sales drop or advancements in Austin). Actively trade on price spikes or drops triggered by news releases, aiming for quick, short-term gains.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **News-Based Trading**: \n",
            "   - **Rationale**: Utilize upcoming announcements or developments related to Tesla's dealings with the city of Austin and broader market news (like Fed rates).\n",
            "   - **Execution**: Have a rapid response strategy to news articles. For example, if a report indicates progress in Tesla's autonomous vehicle discussions, look to buy on price dips and sell once momentum builds.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Technical Analysis**: \n",
            "   - **Rationale**: Employ technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, and moving averages to identify entry and exit points.\n",
            "   - **Execution**: For high-risk tolerance, focus on 5-minute to 15-minute charts to identify short-term trends. Enter positions when technical indicators show bullish signals following bearish news (e.g., buy after a dip if oversold conditions emerge).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Scalping**: \n",
            "   - **Rationale**: This fast-paced trading technique involves making numerous trades throughout the day to profit from small price changes.\n",
            "   - **Execution**: Set tight target prices and stop losses. Trade based on the immediate market sentiment or small fluctuations caused by intraday news or market reactions while ensuring to pay attention to market volume.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Options Strategies**: \n",
            "   - **Rationale**: Given high volatility, use options for both hedging and speculative trading.\n",
            "   - **Execution**: Consider strategies like buying call options if you anticipate a favorable movement following news, or straddles/strangles during earnings reports or key news dates when expecting significant volatility without directional bias.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Risk Management:\n",
            "- **Stop-Loss Orders**: Always set stop-loss levels to protect against excessive drawdowns due to rapid price swings.\n",
            "- **Position Sizing**: Maintain smaller position sizes relative to your overall capital to manage risk effectively.\n",

            "Tesla ( TSLA ) and BYD ( BYDDF ) are the world's largest electric-vehicle makers.\n",
            "In 2022, China EV and battery giant BYD's vehicle sales raced ahead of Tesla's and are now well more than twice as high. For all-battery electric vehicles (BEVs), BYD seized the crown in Q4 2023. Tesla has regained that title, though BYD looks set to lead again in Q4 2024.\n",
            "Tesla reported a surprise profit gain in Q3, fueled by rebounding margins. Elon Musk was bullish about full-year and 2025 growth as well. BYD reported solid Q3 earnings, with revenue surpassing Tesla for the first time. October and November sales signal a huge fourth quarter.\n",

            "Market Shows Bullish Action With Nvidia On Tap; TradeWeb, Heico Also In Focus\n",
            "But for Tesla and perhaps BYD, the biggest news is Donald Trump's election. Investors are convinced that Trump policies will strongly favor Tesla, with Musk a strong campaign supporter and now co-leading a blue-ribbon government efficiency effort . Meanwhile, Trump has promised massive new China tariffs, hitting an already-struggling Chinese economy.\n",
            "There is a potential Trump wildcard that could up-end the calculus for both EV giants.\n",
            "Tesla stock skyrocketed after U.S. elections to a two-year high. BYD stock has fallen below a key level.\n",
            "Tesla Vs. BYD Sales\n",
            "Tesla delivered 462,890 EVs in Q3, up from Q2's 433,956 and Q3 2023's 435,059. That was in line with various analyst estimates but below some whisper numbers. Also, Tesla relied on China sales, which tend to be lower margin.\n",
            "Tesla also deployed 6.9 gigawatt hours of energy storage products, down from Q2's record 9.4 GWh.\n",
            "Meanwhile, BYD sold a record 1,134,892 vehicles in Q3, up 37.3% vs. a year earlier and 7.6% vs. Q2's 986,720. Plug-in hybrid sales soared 75.6% vs. a year before to 685,830. BEV passenger sales came in at 443,426, up 2.7% vs. a year earlier and 4.1% vs. Q2.\n",
            "Tesla, which only makes BEVs, remained No. 1 in that category in Q3.\n",
            "In November, BYD sold a record 506,804 EVs in November, up 67.9% vs. a year earlier. But it was up just 0.8% vs. October and below some estimates.\n",
            "Out of its 504,003 passenger vehicles, BYD sold 305,938 PHEVs, up 133.1% vs. a year earlier but down 1.6% from October. That snapped an eight-month string of record PHEV sales. BEVs sales came in 198,065, their first record of 2024. They were up 16.4% vs. a year earlier and 4.5% vs. October.\n",
            "Sales of commercial vehicles, including buses, delivery trucks and more, hit a record 2,801 in November, up 433.5% vs. a year earlier and 31.4% vs. October.\n",
            "So far in 2024, BYD has sold 3,757,336 vehicles. It's now passed the official full-year target of 3.6 million EVs in November and should end the year well above the unofficial goal of four million.\n",
            "BYD Eyes BEV Crown\n",
            "On the Q3 earnings call, Musk predicted 2024 deliveries would top last year's total of 1.808 million. That would require record Q4 deliveries of more than 514,925. Right now analysts are predicting around 500,000 in Q4, even with Tesla pushing hard with a vast array of incentives and discounts.\n",
            "BYD's sales are likely to keep rising in the typical year-end push. But simply the October-November levels would mean BYD's BEV sales would total 581,518 in Q4.\n",
            "In all likelihood, Tesla would regain the title in Q1 2025, with Lunar New Year holidays contributing to a sluggish period for China auto sales. But strong orders and expanding overseas operations suggest BYD won't suffer nearly as big of a drop-off in Q1 2025 as it did to start 2024.\n",
            "Tesla, BYD Price Cuts\n",
            "Tesla has slashed prices worldwide starting in late 2022. The EV giant has had to keep cutting prices or boost other incentives to prop up sales, slashing once-mighty profit margins and earnings.\n",
            "In late October, Tesla increased Model 3 and Model Y inventory discounts in the U.S. and announced 0% financing for those EVs. In recent weeks, Tesla has announced free Supercharging and FSD incentives, higher referral bonuses and end-of-lease buyouts in the U.S. In Europe, Model 3 and Y incentives have grown. It also recently announced an end-of-year Model Y price discount.\n",
            "Earlier in 2024, BYD slashed prices on most of its largely refreshed models, helping to revive sales, but since then has largely eschewed discounts.\n",
            "Tesla Models\n",
            "Tesla produces the Model 3, the Model Y, Model X and Model S, as well as the Semi and Cybertruck. The Model Y crossover accounts for the majority of sales.\n",
            "A Model 3 revamp didn't provide much of a sales boost in China and Europe and has been lackluster in the U.S.\n",
            "Cybertruck production has picked up. It's likely to be largely a North American vehicle.\n",
            "Tesla is now selling non-Foundation versions of the Cybertruck in the U.S., reducing the starting price by $20,000, to $79,990. At that price, the Cybertruck should soon be eligible for IRA tax credits. But that still hasn't happened.\n",
            "Anyone can order a Cybertruck with near-term delivery.  Tesla is now trying to generate Cybertruck sales in Canada and a few other countries.\n",
            "All that suggests that the estimated 2 million reservations didn't translate into many sales.\n",
            "Along with other efforts, Tesla's Cybertruck moves reflect a hard push for year-end sales.\n",
            "Tesla has delivered a few dozen Semi vehicles to PepsiCo ( PEP ). By May 2024, a few more customers, including Walmart ( WMT ), had taken possession of at least one Tesla Semi. But it's still unclear what the specs and price for the EV big rig are. Tesla recently said it expected mass production in 2026, but Semi timelines have often slipped by years.\n",
            "Tesla Model Y Refresh, 'Affordable' EV\n",
            "Recent online chatter suggested that Tesla Shanghai was starting low-level production of the long-awaited updated \"Juniper\" Model Y. That might indicate actual deliveries in China by early 2025. It's unclear when Tesla's Berlin and Austin plants might begin output.\n",
            "Like the Model S, X and 3 updates — which didn't boost sales much — the \"Juniper\" Model Y likely will have cosmetic exterior changes. Even a small but noticeable exterior change could help.\n",
            "The EV giant this year ditched long-touted plans for a \"next-generation\" EV and \"revolutionary\" manufacturing. Tesla now plans \"affordable vehicles,\" using existing production lines.\n",
            "In the Q3 earnings report, Tesla said it still sees output of the \"affordable\" vehicle starting in the first half of 2025. That would suggest mass production and deliveries would start in late 2025 or beyond.\n",
            "Musk, on the Q3 call, said the new EV should be sub-$30,000 after incentives. If that means the $7,500 IRA tax credit, the list price would be below $37,500, but perhaps not by much.\n",
            "Tesla still hasn't even shown images for the upcoming \"affordable\" vehicle.\n",
            "The speculation is that Tesla will produce a lower-cost variant of the Model 3 or Model Y, perhaps a hatchback. It's unclear how a low-end EV might fare in various markets, especially in China, without IRA credits.\n",
            "BYD Expansion\n",
            "BYD sells BEVs and PHEVs from around $10,000 to $150,000, with a wide range of models. It's refreshing much of its lineup, while adding several new models. That includes new models for its premium Denza, FangChengBao and Yangwang brands.\n",
            "BYD recently took full control of Denza, buying the last 10% owned by Mercedes-Benz.\n",
            "A recently launched fifth-generation hybrid system offers touted 2,100 kilometers (1,305 miles) in combined battery-and-gas range. The system, which is being rolled out to new and existing models, is fueling booming orders.\n",
            "Improved driver-assist systems and faster charging also are expanding to more of BYD's lineup.\n",
            "Overseas sales have declined as a share of total sales in recent months, but BYD has big plans.\n",
            "Export logistics have improved, in terms of ships and rail.\n",
            "BYD's brand-new Thailand plant, its first full-assembly plant outside of China, has begun deliveries. There's also a knock-down plant in Uzbekistan, which puts together partially assembled vehicles.\n",
            "A Brazil factory is due to fully open in early 2025. The EV giant also has intents to build factories in Hungary, Indonesia, Turkey, Cambodia and Pakistan.\n",
            "Turkey has a customs union with the EU. That, along with the Hungary plant, will be two factories for Europe. The Cambodia and Pakistan plants will likely be knock-down plants.\n",
            "The EV giant also is close to choosing a Mexico site and may set up in Vietnam as well. BYD may be waiting on Trump developments before selecting a Mexico site.\n",
            "BYD makes EV buses in California, but says it has no plans to enter the U.S. passenger EV market, amid import tariffs and political opposition. However, Trump has said he wants Chinese EV makers to build cars in the U.S.\n",
            "Tesla Vs. BYD Batteries\n",
            "Tesla traditionally has not mass produced its own batteries. For lithium-ion batteries, its joint venture partner Panasonic makes the cells and Tesla packages them. It also buys lithium-ion batteries from South Korea's LG. Tesla also buys a lot of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from China's CATL as well as some LFP batteries from BYD.\n",
            "Tesla is working on 4680 batteries, first touted at the 2020 Battery Day. The 4680 batteries are standard lithium-ion chemistry, but the EV giant claimed the larger form factor offers the potential for various benefits and cost savings. Tesla's 4680 production has picked up in recent months.\n",
            "Tesla has hinted at progress on the \"dry cathode\" problem, but reportedly mass-production issues remain. It appears that the 4680 battery density is only now reaching that of traditional 2170 cells. Tesla does get some IRA tax credits from making its own batteries.\n",
            "Tesla is a major battery storage provider, though it gets its batteries from CATL.\n",
            "BYD, meanwhile, is one of the world's largest EV battery makers. Its Blade batteries are a specialized form of lithium ferrous phosphate (LFP) or lithium iron phosphate batteries. BYD supplies third-party EV makers, including Xiaomi, XPeng's Mona sub-brand, Nio's Orvo brand and Toyota. BYD supplies some EV batteries to Tesla Berlin.\n",
            "BYD reportedly will unveil a next-generation Blade battery in 2025, with longer range and faster charging. That, along with various other models, could help rev up BEV sales growth next year.\n",
            "BYD expects solid-state batteries for high-end models by 2027, but not fully reaching lower-end models until 2030-2032.\n",
            "BYD is a major battery storage provider. It reportedly will be a supplier to Tesla's upcoming Shanghai Megapack factory.\n",
            "Tesla Full Self-Driving\n",
            "Around Thanksgiving, Tesla began rolling out FSD v13 to employees and at least some outside customers. The EV giant has claimed a six-times improvement with the latest upgrade in terms of miles driven without a human intervention.\n",
            "Right now, FSD v13 appears to be a limited version, but has the ability to unpark, reverse, and park.\n",
            "Musk said on the Q3 earnings call that Tesla will achieve unsupervised FSD by mid-2025 in California and Texas He's said for years that Tesla would achieve self-driving \"this year\" or \"next year.\"\n",
            "At the Tesla robotaxi event , Elon Musk showed off the two-seat Cybercab, with butterfly doors and no steering wheel. Musk expects the Cybercab price tag will be below $30,000, with production starting \"before 2027.\"\n",
            "Tesla is moving toward offering FSD in China. But many automakers offer Level 2 systems there, or better, often at no cost.\n",
            "Tesla has slashed the FSD price to $8,000 from $12,000 and a peak of $15,000. That came after halving the FSD subscription price to $99 a month from $199.\n",
            "On the Q3 earnings call, Musk conceded for the first time Tesla EVs running Hardware 3.0 may not ever achieve FSD, despite Musk's past pledges that they were \"hardware ready.\"\n",
            "Tesla's Other Businesses\n",
            "Tesla has its own Supercharger network in its markets. That's especially important in the U.S., where third-party charging facilities are limited.\n",
            "Tesla has deals with most automakers for access to Superchargers in the U.S. They'll also adopt the charger standard Tesla uses. Those deals, and some related charging subsidies, will boost revenue. But they reduce Tesla's charging moat in the U.S., which encouraged people to buy its EVs.\n",
            "Tesla also has a solar installation business, but it's been struggling for years.\n",
            "Tesla's self-driving ambitions continue. Musk is doubling down on FSD.\n",
            "Tesla also is pursuing a humanoid robot, Optimus, saying he expects it to be a multitrillion dollar business. He showed off many Optimus robots at the Oct. 10 robotaxi events, but they were largely teleoperated.\n",
            "\"We should be thought of as an AI or robotics company,\" Musk has told investors. \"If somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor.\"\n",
            "BYD's Other Businesses\n",
            "BYD, notably, makes its own chips. That, along with in-house batteries and other vertical integrations, help make BYD a low-cost EV maker.\n",
            "The EV and battery giant also has solar operations.\n",
            "BYD is introducing Level 2 driver-assistance systems in its premium brand models as well as more mainstream BYD brand offerings. Those services have been introduced in the premium Denza line and starting to filter down to its higher-end BYD-brand EVs in the coming months.\n",
            "BYD reportedly aims to start equipping lower-end models with higher-end driver-assistance next year.\n",
            "BYD Co. is largely known for its BYD Auto operations. BYD Electronics, which accounts for an increasingly smaller share of overall revenue, is involved in mostly low-margin businesses such as smartphone components and assembly. But margins are improving there as well.\n",
            "EU Hikes Tariffs On Chinese EVs\n",
            "The European Union has started imposing additional tariffs of up to 35.3% on Chinese BEVs. That's on top of the current 10% duties.\n",
            "Specifically, the EU will impose an extra 17% tariff on BYD's BEVs. But, the new duties don't apply to PHEVs, a big plus for BYD.\n",
            "Notably, the EU will only impose a 7.8% extra tariff on Tesla's China made-vehicles. Tesla Shanghai exports the Model 3 to the EU. The EV maker in July hiked Model 3 prices in Europe slightly, further weighing on sales there amid big declines in overall EV sales.\n",
            "Trump Election Impact On Tesla, BYD\n",
            "Elon Musk was a huge supporter of Trump's election bid, contributing tens of millions of dollars and actively campaigning with the former president.\n",
            "President-elect Donald Trump named Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to \"dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies.\"\n",
            "There's widespread hope that Trump's presidency will help Tesla, though that is unclear.\n",
            "Trump has said he wants to eliminate IRA tax credits, including the $7,500 tax credit on EVs.\n",
            "Eliminating the EV credit — which needs congressional action — would hit Tesla's U.S. margins and sales, especially for the upcoming \"affordable\" vehicle. It might reduce traditional automakers' EV efforts over time. However, Calif. Gov Gavin Newsom says if IRA tax credits are scrapped, he'll reintroduce credits in the EV-heavy state, but with market share limits that exclude Tesla.\n",
            "Team Trump also is mulling a rollback of fuel-economy and emission standards. That would reduce the de facto mandate for EVs. However, California and some other blue states have implicit or explicit EV mandates, so GM, Ford and others might continue to push ahead with EVs. Reducing fuel-economy standards also would reduce traditional OEMs' need to buy zero emission credits from Tesla.\n",
            "Trump's transition team reportedly wants a federal framework for self-driving vehicles , something Musk has argued for. But regulation isn't the hurdle for Tesla robotaxis, which face no such restrictions in states such in Texas and Florida.\n",
            "However, the risk that federal regulators could impose serious penalties or restrictions over Tesla's self-driving systems and claims has probably been lifted.\n",
            "Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose 60% tariffs on China, and said in late November that he would impose an immediate 10% hike on his first day in office. That wouldn't have much impact on BYD directly, but would hit China's economy, where BYD gets nearly all its sales. Tesla China sales also could be hurt, especially if patriotic boycotts or government action vs. the EV maker takes place.\n",
            "There is one potential massive wildcard. Trump has voiced his support for Chinese EV makers setting up plants in the U.S. If he did so as president, BYD would likely rush to take advantage. That would have serious implications for Tesla.\n",
            "Tesla Earnings\n",
            "In the third quarter, Tesla earnings unexpectedly rose 9% vs. a year earlier, snapping a four-quarter string of declines. Revenue climbed 8% to $25.2 billion, slightly missing.\n",
            "But gross margins jumped to 19.8%, up 195 basis points vs. a year earlier. Record Tesla Energy margins, lower raw material costs, FSD revenue recognition and positive Cybertruck margins were among the factors.\n",
            "Heavy Q4 incentives and lower Cybertruck prices suggest margins could fall sequentially in Q4.\n",
            "BYD Earnings\n",
            "BYD's Q3 earnings rose 16%, slightly above views. Sales jumped 29% to $28.7 billion, with growth accelerating for a second straight quarter but just missing views. However, BYD revenue topped Tesla's for the first time .\n",
            "BYD's gross margin was 21.89% vs. 18.96% a year earlier. BYD Auto margins popped to 23.51% vs. 22.51% in Q3 2023.\n",
            "R&D and capital spending costs continue to climb rapidly.\n",
            "Tesla Stock Technicals\n",
            "Tesla stock is up 38.9% so far in 2024 as of Nov. 29, according to MarketSurge analysis .\n",
            "Shares spiked 29% in the week ended Nov. 8, turbocharged by Trump's election, blasting out of a base to a two-year high. Shares paused last week as the broader Trump trade faded and investors mulled the implications of losing EV credits in the U.S. But they are back near recent highs.\n",
            "Shares are holding right around recent two-year highs.\n",
            "Tesla stock rose modestly Monday amid the FSD v13 rollout.\n",
            "BYD Stock Technicals\n",
            "BYD stock is up 19% in 2024 through Nov. 29.\n",
            "In early October, BYD topped the official 36.27 buy point, and quickly hit a two-year high of 42 before pulling back. Shares now appear to be forging a new base, which could be viewed as a double-bottom with a 39 buy point. But shares are currently below their 50-day line, riding a five-week losing streak.\n",
            "Much of BYD's recent rise and fall reflected hopes and disappointment over China stimulus hitting Chinese stocks broadly, as well as Trump tariff fears.\n",
            "Shares rose slightly on Dec. 2.\n",
            "BYD, listed in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, trades over the counter in the U.S. Its U.S. shares often have mini-gaps as well as opening trade mini-spikes or tumbles before settling down.\n",
            "Tesla Vs. BYD Market Cap\n",
            "Tesla stock has a market cap of $1.11 trillion as of Nov. 29. It's far above BYD's $89.9billion.\n",
            "Tesla Stock Vs. BYD Stock\n",
            "BYD sells far more EVs than Tesla, though the latter still leads in BEVs, at least for now. More broadly, BYD in many ways is the EV maker Tesla has claimed or aspired to be. BYD makes its own batteries and chips, and sells those batteries to third parties such as Tesla. Musk has talked about making a $25,000 Tesla, though he dismissed the idea on the Q3 earnings call. BYD makes EVs profitably at far below $25,000.\n",
            "The Tesla Cybertruck is relatively new, but shipments are still low. It's unclear if yet-unseen upcoming \"affordable\" variants of aging vehicles will have a meaningful impact, or if the Model Y refresh will have a big, last impact.\n",
            "BYD has entered most of the world outside of the U.S. Its model lineup continues to expand dramatically, with big moves upscale and adding tech to its more-affordable offerings.\n",
            "BYD's broad lineup and next-generation hybrid system means it's reaping the benefits of a global shift toward PHEVs over BEVs. Even so, BYD seems on track to regain the BEV crown in Q4.\n",
            "Tesla stock has surged on Trump's election, extended from any buy point. BYD stock has pulled back below key support, but does have a new base.\n",
            "Keep your eyes on BYD and Tesla, as well as Tesla stock vs. BYD stock.\n",

            "To effectively leverage a momentum trading strategy for Tesla (TSLA) considering its volatile nature, recent news impacts, and current market conditions, it’s crucial to take the following insights into account:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Market Sentiment and Price Movement**: TSLA experienced a significant decline of 18% in October 2023, ending the month at approximately $200.84. This decline was exacerbated by reports of demand woes, particularly concerning the 13% sales drop in Europe as electric vehicle (EV) competition intensified. The shift in market sentiment has resulted in a substantial valuation loss, wiping out around $145 billion. Such volatility is not uncommon in TSLA, and traders should be prepared for rapid price changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Key Drivers and New Developments**: Recent news focuses on Tesla's advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, particularly its talks with Austin to deploy such technology. Positive developments in this area can potentially create bullish momentum for TSLA, especially if successful trials or widespread adoption are announced. The potential of new technology could capture market interest and shift sentiment positively, which is a critical factor for momentum trading.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Catalysts for Entry Points**: With TSLA trading near significant resistance levels, traders should look for additional catalysts such as successful product launches, favorable regulatory changes, or boosted earnings from autonomous initiatives. The recent rollout of Full Self-Driving v13 has heightened expectations; thus, traders should monitor how the market reacts to reported performance metrics in the following weeks.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Strategic Entry and Exit**: Given the stock's volatility, entry on dips close to crucial support levels (around $190) can be considered, while ensuring to set stop-loss orders to manage risk effectively. Conversely, momentum traders can exit positions once stocks reach predefined resistance levels, which may be around $220-$230, reacting to news and overall market trends.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Evaluating Broader Market Conditions**: The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain due to inflation concerns and interest rates, which can impact consumer spending on luxury items like EVs. Since TSLA is impacted heavily by public sentiment and economic conditions, awareness of broader market trends is vital for timing trades right.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, a momentum trading strategy for TSLA should emphasize timing based on market conditions, news impacts, and calculated entry/exit points around key technical levels.

            "Imagine this: You’ve just entered an options trade. Within seconds, your trade is already profitable. The profit is marginal — a measly 5% of what you risked. But you don’t care, that’s perfect — because you’re scalping options . Scalping, or scalp trading means you’re looking to get in, score a quick buck, and take your profit at the first opportunity. Rinse, repeat, over and over again, as many times as possible throughout the day.\n",
            "Like a true guerrilla warrior, a scalp trader likes it best when they slip in and slip out, undetected by the rest of the market and unhesitant with their actions. As such, scalp traders typically rely on timely reactions , technical analysis , and tight trading plans — which include an exit plan for the good times and for the bad times .\n",
            "Real-Life Scalping Options: Trading Example Using Tesla Puts\n",
            "“It ain’t much, but it’s honest work.” Source: ThinkOrSwim , Market Rebellion\n",
            "The 8-second video above depicts a quick, real-life scalp example using a single Tesla (TSLA) put weekly contract, bought for $4.90 and sold for $5.12 in two and a half minutes for a quick +$20.70 profit ($22-($0.65*2)), for roughly +4.5%. This trade was made using ThinkOrSwim’s web platform, by this author, for the purpose of this article.\n",
            "On its own, that 4.5% isn’t going to move the needle for most people. But for traders with a consistent win rate, those small wins can add up fast.\n",
            "Perhaps most importantly, notice that shares of the underlying stock ( Tesla , which has been falling for several weeks now) only needed to move a few cents in the direction of the trade in order for the trade to reach its profit target. This is part of the allure of scalping.\n",
            "Common Scalp Trading Timeframes\n",
            "Everybody’s different, and there is no rigid timeline for exactly how short a scalp trade must be. However, many consider a successful scalp to be a trade that hits its intended profit in less than 10 minutes — and way less if possible.\n",
            "Scalp traders usually look for short-time technical signals like intraday breakouts, an overbought or oversold RSI, and bullish or bearish chart patterns.\n",
            "Because scalp traders are looking to trade in as short a timeframe as possible, the timeframe of their indicators must reflect that — for instance, scalpers are likely to lean heavily on 1-minute and 5-minute candlestick charts, while a swing trader (someone looking to remain in a trade for days to weeks) might be watching candles like the 1-hour, or even the 1-day.\n",
            "For a swing trader, 1-minute and 5-minute candles are simply noise. For a scalp trader, 1-day candles are simply irrelevant.\n",

            "For those who love the act of trading, scalping can be fun and rewarding\n",
            "_\n",
            "Scalp trading has a variety of benefits. For traders who are comfortable with spending a lot of time in front of the charts, and who enjoy the act of opening and closing trades, scalping can be as exciting as it is lucrative. The quick “win or lose” can feel thrilling and competitive — however, you must always keep in mind that this is not a game .\n",
            "In high-frequency trading, it takes an iron-will and a complete ability to detach from emotion in order to achieve consistency. And consistency is exactly what is required of a successful scalp trader.\n",
            "Scalping can also be particularly helpful for aggressive traders with small to medium-sized accounts. That’s because scalp trading lends itself to risking small amounts of capital relative to the amount one might risk when making a swing trade or even a day trade. This is part of why scalping and options trading go together like peanut butter and jelly.\n",
            "The short-term nature of scalp trades and the propensity to risk small amounts of capital pair well with short-duration option contracts. While theta decay is always a risk when trading short-term options, scalpers largely mitigate this risk by entering and exiting trades before much of any time has passed at all.\n",
            "Moreover, tools like 0DTE options with lightning-fast gamma acceleration can turn small moves in the underlying stock into palpable profit — if you know how to handle the trade . On that note, here are a few things to beware of if you plan to sightsee in the world of scalping.\n",
            "Negatives of Scalp Trading\n",
            "Commissions can burn a hole in your wallet\n",
            "Hours of screen time can burn a hole in your retinas\n",
            "Requires at least some technical analysis know-how\n",
            "_\n",
            "First and foremost, just because scalping can be great for small accounts, doesn’t mean it’s great for every small amount. It’s true that scalp traders typically risk small amounts of capital when making their trades, but scalp traders also pay a large amount in commissions relative to lower frequency traders.\n",
            "For instance, imagine that you’re scalping, and on average, you’re buying and selling 10-lot option orders.\n",
            "VOCAB CHECK — LOT : A lot refers to the quantity of units you are trading, whether that’s shares of stock or options contracts. A “round lot” is 100, and an “odd lot” is exactly what it sounds like — an odd-sized order typically less than 100 contracts or shares.\n",
            "Also, imagine that the brokerage you’re using charges $0.65 per contract for each open or closed order. So, in the 10 minutes it may have taken you to open and close that 10-lot option order, you’ve spent $13.00 . Realistically, if you’re a true scalp trader, you’ll be doing this many times throughout the day. However, don’t start panicking yet.\n",
            "That $13 isn’t the end of the world — it just means you need to account for the cost of commissions in your trading plan. If your profit target was $100, maybe now it’s $113. Likewise, if the potential for profit is so minuscule that it won’t confidently make up the commission costs, it is of course best to avoid it entirely.\n",
            "While there are some commission-free brokerages, the order execution is often subpar. Robinhood and WeBull are examples of this. As a rule, remember that no one is really trying to let you trade for free. Whether it’s through commissions or poor order execution, brokerages are here to make money — and you are the customer.\n",

            "Take the First Step\n",
            "Lastly, scalp traders must be dedicated to their craft. All trading is serious business, but it takes a lot more commitment to sit in front of the screen searching for many opportunities a day than it does to buy LEAPS or to hold onto a few swing trades. That’s because in scalping, every second counts. It isn’t just about the literal time it takes to open and close dozens of trades.\n",
            "Scalp traders need to be comfortable with the technicals, and that will also take time. It isn’t required that you become a licensed CMT or understand every single indicator, but knowledge of some common chart patterns and indicators will go a long way. And conversely, without an understanding of at least the basics, you’re running blind. Risking less per trade may sound less risky, but for those who haven’t perfected their scalp trading strategy, repetitive losses can stack up just as quickly as the wins.\n",
            "In short, if you’re not willing to put in the time, you’re probably going to get nickel-and-dimed.\n",
            "The Bottom Line: Option Scalping Can Be Great\n",
            "You already know this, but we’ll say it again for good measure: In the stock market, there’s no free lunch. There’s no secret knowledge of one particular strategy that will make it easy for you to succeed. Every strategy requires discipline, practice, dedication, and a little bit of luck won’t hurt either.\n",
            "Scalping is no exception. While it can be great for small accounts, a scalp trading strategy is one of the more difficult in the trading world.\n",
            "They require fast reaction times. The ability to make a plan and stick to it. Knowledge of options and knowledge of technical analysis — and at that, they generally require the use of the shortest duration (and highest risk) contracts. Still, like any trading strategy, if you’re motivated and determined to succeed — then you will.\n",

            "Pegged by many as a high-risk, high-reward stock, Tesla Motors , Inc. (TSLA) ranks among the most interesting public companies in the world. Founder Elon Musk is a controversial superstar in the technology industry, and Tesla's Silicon Valley roots have boosted investor expectations. Tesla attracted even more attention in 2021 when the company reached a trillion-dollar market cap–a stratospheric valuation that had only been reached by a handful of megatitans.\n",
            "The future of Tesla has exciting potential but remains difficult to predict. TSLA investors should temper their expectations and consider how the potential risks that Tesla may face over the next five to ten years.\n",
            "Key Takeaways\n",
            "The electric vehicle (EV) maker, Tesla, has a number of key risks that it will face in the next 5-10 years.\n",
            "Notable risks include Tesla cars being too expensive with tax breaks and that the construction of its Gigafactory (battery factory) taking longer than expected.\n",
            "More broadly speaking, Tesla faces a competitive environment from both legacy automakers and other EV manufacturers.\n",
            "Tesla's future success will depend heavily on ramping up manufacturing capacity and infrastructure.\n",
            "The Tesla brand is closely associated with Elon Musk , a CEO whose visionary ambitions are matched by his propensity for scandal.\n",
            "1. Tesla Cars Are Still Too Expensive\n",
            "Even with generous government incentives, such as tax breaks for alternative technology, potential consumers of Tesla's Model S are still faced with a large price tag that starts at $94,990 before any incentives or discounts, as of November 2021. Even Tesla's new lower-cost option, Model 3, is $43,990 before tax incentives and gas savings, as of May 2021—which is still out of reach for most drivers.\n",
            "The cars are not only expensive for consumers to purchase, but they're also costly for Tesla to make. Vertical Group analyst Gordon Johnson estimated that the company lost roughly $14,000 on each of the Model 3 vehicles it sold in 2018, although these figures may improve as the company scales up.\n",
            "2. Tesla Could Run Out of Batteries\n",
            "One of the early problems Tesla executives ran into was a lack of batteries to power their products. Tesla's world-renowned Gigafactory, which is still under construction in Sparks, Nev., is supposed to solve the company's battery crisis . The lithium-ion manufacturing plant, with a planned footprint of more than 1.9 million square feet, projects to help ramp production to more than 500,000 Tesla cars annually.\n",
            "Major projects such as the Gigafactory are often plagued with logistical or regulatory hurdles, and it remains to be seen if the factory can be completed on time. The Nevada government has given the green light to the Gigafactory, which is expected to produce $100 billion in additional economic activity over the subsequent decades.\n",
            "Although the facility is only 30% complete, one gigafactory may not be enough, and Musk has hinted that the company may need several such facilities to meet demand. It is going to take an incredible amount of capital expenditures (CapEx) to keep the company fully charged and shareholders happy.\n",
            "Tesla was the largest manufacturer of plug-in electric vehicles, with 14.55% of all worldwide sales in the first half of 2021. The next largest manufacturer was VW Group, with 12.52%.\n",
            "3. Low Gas Prices\n",
            "When gas prices tumbled in 2014 and 2015, Tesla lost some of its luster. After all, gasoline-powered cars compete with Tesla's products, and declining gas prices make gasoline-powered cars more economically attractive. Gas prices do not have to remain at decade lows to damage TSLA stock prices; it just has to be cheap enough to keep legacy cars on the road.\n",
            "TSLA's gas quandary comes from two angles at once. The first problem is increased global production in oil; the once-dominant \"peak oil\" theory seems to be debunked, with global oil production increasing every year from 2009 through 2019. Oil companies are getting better at finding oil and, with the help of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, they are also more effective at extracting oil.\n",
            "Petroleum supplies are increasing and, at the same time, internal combustion engines are more fuel-efficient. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the average fuel efficiency of light-duty passenger cars in the U.S. continues to improve.\n",
            "If Tesla is going to transition into a mainstream auto manufacturer and generate consistent cash flow , it needs to sell a lot more cars. Consumers are less likely to transition to electric cars if petroleum-based fuels remain a far cheaper alternative .\n",
            "4. Increased Electric Vehicle Competition\n",
            "Tesla is not the first company to create electric cars. Interestingly, the first electric automobiles were probably created as early as 1834 by Thomas Davenport, but Tesla seems to be the most successful, thus far.\n",
            "Two notable competitors, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Nissan Leaf, failed to gain early traction because of high retail prices and limited driving range. The Nissan Leaf starts at $27,400 before incentives, with a range of up to 226 miles, as of October 2021.\n",
            "The 2022 model of the Chevrolet Bolt, starting at $31,000 before incentives, with a range of 259 miles, offers more than the 220-mile range of Tesla's standard Model 3, as of October of 2021. Other companies plan to enter the electric car market in the next few years, including Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Subaru, Ford, and BMW. If this happens, then Tesla's market share may start to get crowded.\n",
            "Some tech companies may also join the fray; Apple, Inc. believes it can challenge Tesla in the transportation industry, and Google has also placed bets on the auto industry . Tesla is admittedly concerned about businesses with broader existing consumer bases.\n",
            "5. Tesla May Never Recoup Massive Expenditures\n",
            "Musk once famously noted about his company, \"We are going to spend staggering amounts of money on CapEx.\" Lots of investors like to see high capital expenditures, but there has to be a payoff on the other end. This seems particularly true in an infant industry paved with failed startups.\n",
            "Tesla has already spent billions on development for the Model 3 and Model X cars, and the battery factory comes with its own hefty price tag. In an SEC filing for the first quarter of 2021, Tesla estimated that capital expenditures would likely ramp up to $4.5 or even $6 billion per year.\n",
            "$6 Billion\n",
            "According to SEC filings, Tesla may spend as much as six billion per year on capital expenditures in the coming years.\n",
            "6. A Controversial, Part-Time CEO\n",
            "The same quarterly filing included a note about Tesla's reliance on Elon Musk . Tesla is \"highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer,\" the company said.\n",
            "This is not particularly shocking, especially in the technology sector; think of Steve Jobs and Apple . Perhaps more concerning is what follows shortly after: \"he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla.\"\n",
            "Musk is a very active executive. He was once CEO of PayPal before joining Tesla and has since become CEO and Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of Space Exploration Technologies. He is also Chair of SolarCity, which installs expensive solar equipment. The loss of a key executive could be a substantial setback for the company.\n",
            "Moreover, the eccentric CEO has proved a lightning rod for scandal, as might be expected from a self-appointed \"Technoking.\" The same quarterly filing notes that there are now nine pending class-action lawsuits against Tesla and Musk, relating to a 2018 tweet in which Musk falsely announced plans to take the company private. The tweet is alleged to have been an effort to manipulate TSLA's share price, a violation of federal securities laws.\n",
            "Musk's impulsive behavior also has real-world consequences. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Musk repeatedly aired misinformation about the pandemic and criticized lockdown restrictions as \"fascist\" in an earnings call with Tesla investors. He later defied public health authorities by reopening Tesla's Bay Area plant, causing a cluster of 450 infections.\n",
            "The Bottom Line\n",
            "With a trillion-dollar valuation, Tesla's success as an electric vehicle manufacturer is hard to dispute. However, there are still many potential hurdles to overcome, from the difficulty of developing affordable EV technology to the risks posed by competing firms.\n",
